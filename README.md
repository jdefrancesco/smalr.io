A dated half-assed project that myself and MadHax never completed, but at the very leaat we got to play with Django.. I would like to actually finish this one day and have it be what I had originally envisioned.. Everey now and again I dabble in the darkside of web-dev.

# Smalr.io  - DRAFT

Django based secure link shortening service. To be hosted on the cloud (which server is to be determined)

## Code
Relevant code is stored in this repository which is setup as a standard Django project!

## How do I get set up? 
If added to the project, new user should clone this repository and use the following git workflow.

1. Create your own local branch via. `git checkout -b feature`
2. Add your code to the new branch (rebase from master) `git rebase master`
3. Commit code to your new branch
4. Checkout master branch and pull most recent changes from server with `git pull origin master`
5. Merge the branch you were working on into main via `git merge branch`
6. If all works well you can push the changes to our sever repo: `git push`

**NOTE:**  Make sure your code is clean and well documented! Remember to supply useful commit messages that include what you changed/added 
and why you did so! I recommend not supplying -m flag to commit so you can write you messages in your text editor! I have
to remember to do this as well.. :-\
